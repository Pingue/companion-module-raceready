- `$(raceready:actiontext_pos1)` to `$(raceready:actiontext_pos30)` - Action text by position

## Installation

1. Install the module through the Companion Module Manager
2. Add a new instance and select "RaceReady" from the list
3. Configure the connection settings (see Configuration section)

## Configuration

### Connection Settings
- **Target IP**: IP address of the RaceReady server (default: localhost)
- **Target Port**: WebSocket port of the RaceReady server (default: 3000)

### RaceReady Server Setup
Ensure your RaceReady server is running and accessible on the network. The module connects via WebSocket and supports real-time updates.

## Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Create a new Companion page for your race checklist
2. Add buttons with RaceReady actions (Toggle Action by Position, Next/Previous Checklist)
3. Configure feedbacks to show action states and checklist information
4. Use variables to display dynamic checklist content

Alternatively use the pre-configured export page from the raceready web interface.

### Example Button Configurations

#### Action Toggle Button
- **Action**: "Toggle Action by Position" (Position: 1)
- **Feedback**: "Race Ready Action State by Position" (Position: 1)
- **Style**: Green when complete, red when incomplete

#### Checklist Navigation
- **Action**: "Next Checklist" or "Previous Checklist"
- **Feedback**: "Current Checklist Name" or "Current Checklist Index"

#### Status Display
- **Feedback**: "Race Ready Overall State" to show if all actions are complete
- **Variable**: Use `$(raceready:current_checklist_name)` to display active checklist

## Advanced Features

### Position-Based Actions
Actions are referenced by their position (1-30) within the current checklist, not by their database ID. This ensures consistent button mapping regardless of checklist content changes.

### Real-Time Updates
The module receives live updates from the RaceReady server, automatically refreshing:
- Action completion states
- Checklist changes
- Navigation updates

### Multi-Device Support
Multiple Companion instances can connect to the same RaceReady server, enabling distributed control across different devices or team members.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify the RaceReady server is running and accessible
- Check IP address and port configuration
- Ensure no firewall blocking WebSocket connections (default port 3000)

### Feedback Not Updating
- Check that checklist data is loaded (may take a moment on first connection)
- Verify WebSocket connection is established
- Review Companion logs for any error messages

### Actions Not Working
- Ensure position numbers match available actions in the current checklist
- Check that RaceReady server is responding to WebSocket commands
- Verify you're referencing valid position numbers (1-based)

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Events
The module handles the following RaceReady WebSocket events:
- `all_data` - Complete action dataset
- `partial_data` - Individual action updates
- `get_checklists` - Request checklist metadata
- `checklists` - Checklist data response
- `current_checklist` - Active checklist changes

### State Management

- Handles multiple checklists with position-based action mapping
- Provides robust error handling and graceful degradation
